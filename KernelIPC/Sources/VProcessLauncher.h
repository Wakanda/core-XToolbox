/** brief	class VProcessLauncher
 
	Launch an "external" (== not the current app.) process: a command file, an application, a monitor's shell command, ...
	Basically, it does about the same as if you entered the command in the Terminal (Mac) or the Command prompt (Windows).

	Different optionnal parameters/settings let the caller to:
			- Fill STDIN
			- Read the result from STDOUT
			- Read an error from STDERR
			- Send environment variables to the child
			- Set a default directory for the child
			- Wait until the child ends or return immediately

	By default:
			- Call is blocking: father waits until child ends.
			- A console window is opened on Windows (not on Mac)

	There are 2 way for using this class:
		- A high level static routine lets you to do everyting in one call. For example:
				sLONG err = VProcessLauncher::ExecuteCommandLine( CVSTR("chmod +x /Users/username/Desktop/TestLEP.txt") );

			or, with results expected:
				VString		commandLine("/bin/cat /Users/username/Desktop/TestLEP.txt");
				VMemoryBuffer<>		resultOut, resultErr;
	 
				sLONG err = VProcessLauncher::ExecuteCommandLine(commandLine, eVPLOption_HideConsole, NULL, &resultOut, &outStdErr);

		- More low level routines lets you to set the parameters, read result manually, shutdown the child, ...
		  Basically, if you look how VProcessLauncher::ExecuteCommandLine() works, you'll see how low level routines work

	--------------------
	IMPORTANT
	--------------------
	When using VProcessLauncher, don't forget to quote what must be quoted, to escape chars that must be espaced, etc. For example, on Windows,
	if you open a document using the "start" command, this will work...
 
			VProcessLauncher::ExecuteCommandLine("cmd.exe /C start \"\" \"C:\\My Document With Spaces.txt\"");
 
	...because the document <My Document With Spaces.txt> is quoted. But the following call will fail because there are no quotes and spaces:
			VProcessLauncher::ExecuteCommandLine("cmd.exe /C start \"\" C:\\My Document With Spaces.txt");
